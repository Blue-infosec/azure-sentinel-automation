# azu-sentinel-automation
Examples for automating **Azure Sentinel** deployment and configuration.

### /terraform ###

- Deploy Log Analytics Workspace.
- Deploy Sentinel.
- Configure RBAC for built-in Sentinel roles.

### /alertrules (coming up later) ### 

- There are plenty of public domain Alert Rules and Hunting Queries for incident response & hunting - my idea is mainly to write "self-monitoring" rules that insure Sentinel & log data confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Disclaimers:**
- This is a personal collection. If you decide to use any of this, please review it well. 
- Everything is built and tested on my personal Azure tenant, using current binaries in Azure Cloud Shell.
